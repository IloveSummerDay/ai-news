      "content": "<p>For years, I’ve puzzled over a question that seems to defy common sense: If stock markets are <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-5-graphics-2025-09-15/\">hitting records</a> and tech innovation seems endless, why aren’t companies pouring money back into new projects? </p>\n\n<p>Yes, they’re still investing – but the pace of business spending is slower than you’d expect, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2025/08/18/how-americas-ai-boom-is-squeezing-the-rest-of-the-economy\">especially outside of AI</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And if you’ve noticed headlines about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67a6d06d-0ecf-4a8b-98d8-1b1254e49035\">sluggish business spending</a> even as corporate profits soar, you’re not alone. It’s a puzzle that’s confounded economists, policymakers and investors for decades. Back in 1975, U.S. public companies reinvested an average of 25 cents for every dollar on their balance sheets. Today, that figure is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">closer to 12 cents</a>. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, corporate America is flush with cash, but it’s surprisingly stingy about reinvesting in its own future. What happened?</p>\n\n<p>I’m <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/business/leeds-directory/faculty/david-ikenberry\">an economist</a>, and my colleague <a href=\"https://business.rice.edu/person/gustavo-grullon\">Gustavo Grullon</a> and I recently published a study in the Journal of Finance that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">turns the field’s conventional wisdom on its head</a>. Our research suggests the issue isn’t cautious executives or jittery markets – it’s about how economists have historically measured companies’ incentives to invest in the first place. </p>\n\n<h2>Asking the wrong Q</h2>\n\n<p>For decades, economists have relied on a simple but appealing ratio – <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/qratio.asp\">Tobin’s Q</a>, named after the famous economist James Tobin – to gauge whether companies should ramp up investment. </p>\n\n<p>They calculate this by dividing a company’s market value – what it would take to purchase the firm outright with cash – by its replacement value, or how much it would cost to rebuild the company from scratch. The result is called “Q.” The higher the Q, the theory goes, the more incentive executives have to invest.</p>\n\n<p>But reality hasn’t conformed to fit the theory. Over the past half-century, Tobin’s Q has gone up, yet investment rates have gone down sharply. </p>\n\n<p>Why the disconnect? Our research points to one key culprit: excess capacity. Many U.S. companies already have more factories, machines or service capability than they can use. By not correcting for this issue, the traditional Tobin’s Q will overstate the incentive that companies have to grow.</p>\n\n<p>To see this, consider a commercial real estate company that owns a portfolio of office buildings. In recent years, with the rise of e-commerce and remote work, many of their properties have been running well below capacity. Now suppose a few new tenants start paying rent and begin absorbing a portion of that empty space. Stock prices will rise in response to seeing these new cash flows, which in turn will lead Q to rise. </p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, this increase in Q would suggest that it’s a good time to invest in new buildings – but the reality is quite different with idle capacity still in the system. Why pour money into building another office tower if existing ones still have empty floors?</p>\n\n<p>This key idea is that what matters isn’t the average value of all assets – it’s the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073115/what-difference-between-marginal-utility-and-marginal-value.asp\">marginal value</a> of adding one more dollar of investment. And because <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capacityutilizationrate.asp\">capacity utilization</a> has been steadily eroding over the past half-century, many firms see little reason to invest.</p>\n\n<p>That last point may come as a surprise, but the U.S. economy, with all its factories and offices, isn’t nearly as abuzz with activity as it was after, say, World War II. Today, many sectors operate <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TCU\">well below full throttle</a>. This growing slack in the system over time helps explain why companies have pulled back on their rate of investment, even as profits and market values climb.</p>\n\n<p>Why has capacity utilization fallen so much over the past half-century? It’s not entirely clear, but what economists call “structural economic rigidities” – things such as regulatory hurdles, labor market frictions or shifts in cost structure – seem to be part of the answer. These factors can drag businesses into a state of chronic underuse, especially after recessions. </p>\n\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n\n<p>This isn’t just an academic debate. The implications are profound, whether you closely follow Wall Street or just enjoy armchair economic policy debates. For one thing, this dynamic might help explain why tax cuts haven’t spurred investment the way supporters have hoped.</p>\n\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text/eh\">2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a>, which slashed the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and introduced <a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/glossary/full-expensing/\">full expensing</a> for equipment investments. Supporters promised a wave of new investment. </p>\n\n<p>But when my colleague and I <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jofi.13439\">looked at the numbers</a>, we found the opposite. In the four years before the tax cuts, publicly traded U.S. firms had an aggregate investment rate, including intangibles, of 13.9%. In the four years after the tax cut, the average investment rate fell to 12.4% – in other words, no evidence of a bump. </p>\n\n<p>Where did those liberated cash flows go? Instead of plowing this newfound cash after the tax cuts into new projects, many companies funneled it into <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/buyback.asp\">stock buybacks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp\">dividends</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In retrospect, this makes sense. If a company has excess capacity, the incentive to invest should be more muted, even if new machines are suddenly cheaper thanks to tax breaks. If the demand isn’t there, why buy them?</p>\n\n<p>Even with the most generous tax incentives, the core challenge remains: You can’t force-feed investment into an economy already swimming in excess capacity. If companies don’t see real, scalable demand, tax breaks alone aren’t likely to unlock a new era of business spending.</p>\n\n<p>That doesn’t mean tax policy doesn’t matter – it does, especially for smaller firms with real growth prospects. But for the large, well-established firms that make up the lion’s share of the economy, the bigger challenge is demand. Rather than trying to stimulate even more investment, policymakers should prioritize understanding why demand is sagging relative to supply and reducing economic rigidities where they can. That way, the capacity generated by new investment has somewhere useful to go.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/260661/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David Ikenberry does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

And for federal workers, it couldn’t come at a worse time.</p>\n\n<p>In the fractious and polarized political landscape of the United States, Democrats and Republicans have come to rely on <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/what-to-know-about-continuing-resolutions/\">short-term, stopgap funding bills</a> to keep the government operating in the absence of <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/introduction-to-the-federal-budget-process\">elusive longer-term budget deals</a>. </p>\n\n<p>With the parties currently wide apart over the terms of even a short-term budget resolution, the government is set to shut down on Oct. 1, 2025, barring an 11th-hour deal that appears far off. If the shutdown does happen, it would mark another difficult moment this year for a federal workforce that has so far <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shed-300000-workers-this-year-trumps-hr-chief-forecasts-2025-08-14/\">shed more than 300,000 jobs</a>. This is largely due to ongoing Trump administration efforts to downsize parts of the federal government and restructure or largely eliminate certain government agencies with the stated aim of increasing efficiency.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zF55F0Y3zD8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            \n          </figure>\n\n<p>With a government shutdown, <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/11/07/impacts-and-costs-government-shutdown\">hundreds of thousands of federal employees</a> would be furloughed – sent home without pay until funding resumes. </p>\n\n<p>As a team of financial economists who study labor markets and public sector employment and have examined millions of federal personnel records spanning such government shutdowns in the past, we have found that the consequences reach far beyond the now-familiar images of closed national parks and stalled federal services. Indeed, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3962279\">based on our study</a> of an October 2013 shutdown during which about 800,000 <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/help/faq/1032\">federal employees were furloughed for 16 days</a>, shutdowns leave an enduring negative effect on the federal workforce, reshaping its composition and weakening its performance for years to come.</p>\n\n<h2>What happens to workers</h2>\n\n<p>Millions of Americans interact with the federal government every day in ways both big and small. More than <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/60419\">one-third of U.S. national spending</a> is routed through government programs, including Medicare and Social Security. Federal workers <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/index.htm\">manage national parks</a>, draft environmental regulations and help keep air travel safe. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever one’s political leanings, if the goal is a government that handles these responsibilities effectively, then attracting and retaining a talented workforce is essential.</p>\n\n<p>Yet the ability of the federal government to do so may be increasingly difficult, in part because prolonged shutdowns can have hidden effects.</p>\n\n<p>When Congress fails to pass appropriations, <a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/guidance-for-shutdown-furloughs.pdf\">federal agencies must furlough employees</a> whose jobs are not deemed “excepted” – sometimes commonly referred to as essential. Those excepted employees keep working, while others are barred from working or even volunteering until funding resumes. Furlough status reflects funding sources and mission categories, not an individual’s performance, so it confers no signal about an employee’s future prospects and primarily acts as a shock to morale.</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, furloughs do not create long-term wealth losses; back pay has always been granted and, <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12251\">since 2019, is legally guaranteed</a>. Employees therefore recover their pay even though they may face real <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-us-news-ap-top-news-ut-state-wire-north-america-5d95c567185f4592b4a6e59fa9317f7c\">financial strain in the short run</a>. </p>\n\n<p>A cynical observer might call furloughs a paid vacation, yet the data tells a different story. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"An empty hallway in the U.S. Capitol.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692962/original/file-20250925-56-wu4ghl.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">An American flag is seen inside the U.S. Capitol Building on Sept. 23, 2025, ahead of a looming government shutdown.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-american-flag-is-seen-inside-the-u-s-capitol-building-on-news-photo/2236976507?adppopup=true\">Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Immediate consequences, longer-term effects</h2>\n\n<p>Using extensive administrative records on federal civilian workers from the October 2013 shutdown, we tracked how this shock to morale rippled through government operations. Employees exposed to furloughs <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3962279\">were 31% more likely to leave their jobs</a> within one year. </p>\n\n<p>These departures were not quickly replaced, forcing agencies to rely on costly temporary workers and leading to measurable declines in core functions such as payment accuracy, legal enforcement and patenting activity. </p>\n\n<p>Further, we found that this exodus builds over the first two years after the shutdown and then settles into a permanently lower headcount, implying a durable loss of human capital. The shock to morale is more pronounced among young, female and highly educated professionals with plenty of outside options. Indeed, our analysis of survey data from a later 2018-2019 shutdown confirms that morale, not income loss, drives the exits. </p>\n\n<p>Employees who felt most affected reported a sharp drop in agency, control and recognition, and they were far more likely to plan a departure. </p>\n\n<p>The effect of the motivation loss is striking. Using a simple economic model where workers can be expected to value both cash and purpose, we estimate that the drop in intrinsic motivation after a shutdown would require a roughly 10% wage raise to offset. </p>\n\n<h2>Policy implications</h2>\n\n<p>Some people have argued that this outflow of employees amounts to a necessary trimming, a way to shrink government by a <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24562740\">so-called starving of the beast</a>. </p>\n\n<p>But the evidence paints a different picture. Agencies hit hardest by furloughs turned to temporary staffing firms to fill the gaps. Over the two years after the shutdown we analyzed, these agencies spent about US$1 billion more on contractors than they saved in payroll. </p>\n\n<p>The costs go beyond replacement spending, as government performance also suffers. Agencies that were more <a href=\"https://www.paymentaccuracy.gov\">affected by the shutdown recorded higher rates</a> of inaccurate federal payments for several years. Even after partial recovery, losses amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars that taxpayers never recouped. </p>\n\n<p>Other skill-intensive functions declined as well. Legal enforcement fell in agencies that became short of experienced attorneys, and patenting activity dropped in science and engineering agencies after key inventors left. </p>\n\n<p>Official estimates of shutdown costs <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IN12248\">typically focus on near-term GDP effects</a> and back pay. But our findings show that an even bigger bill comes later in the form of higher employee turnover, higher labor costs to fill gaps, and measurable losses in productivity. </p>\n\n<p>Shutdowns are blunt, recurring shocks that demoralize the public workforce and erode performance. These costs spill over to everyone who relies on government services. If the public wants efficient, accountable public institutions, then we should all care about avoiding shutdowns.</p>\n\n<p>After an already turbulent year, it is unclear whether an upcoming shutdown would significantly add to the strain on federal employees or have a more limited effect, since many who were considering leaving have already left through buyouts or forced terminations this year. What is clear is that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are likely to experience another period of uncertainty.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265723/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

In this research, published in August 2025 in the journal <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/home/soq\">Strategic Organization</a>, we found that not all CEO scandals are treated equally: The type makes all the difference. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"An exuberant woman in the stands at a Phillies game is shown on a jumbotron holding up a sign reading: We are not here cheating on our significant others -- go Phils!\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692023/original/file-20250921-56-oxjsze.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Coldplay incident became the subject of ridicule at public events for days, such as at this July 18, 2025, Major League Baseball game.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/fan-holds-up-a-sign-during-a-kiss-cam-segment-in-the-game-news-photo/2226031757\">Isaiah Vazquez/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Personal scandals are harder to survive</h2>\n\n<p>For most people, personal indiscretions – such as having an extramarital affair or abusing drugs – are a private matter. But for CEOs, even scandals unrelated to business create doubt about their judgment, integrity and leadership. The result is <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/smj.2922\">usually career-ending for the CEO</a>, research shows, and can create lasting harm for the company. </p>\n\n<p>We found that CEOs overwhelmingly exit in the wake of personal scandals – five times as often as CEOs who commit financial misconduct do, in fact. And strong business performance doesn’t tend to offer protection.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Hewlett-Packard’s Mark Hurd, who’s widely credited with turning around HP in the mid-2000s, was ousted following a <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-hurd-jodie-fisher-hp-2011-12\">very visible personal misconduct scandal</a> 15 years ago. The fallout was swift: The company’s stock <a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/leadership-organisations/mark-hurd-affair\">fell nearly 10%</a> immediately after the announcement, and with leadership in a tailspin, it dropped more than 40% within a year.</p>\n\n<h2>Why bad numbers come with better odds</h2>\n\n<p>Companies are also routinely accused of “cooking the books.” In recent months, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/716c4ad5-e8fa-4a34-afba-9fb2d1db019d\">several firms have been forced</a> <a href=\"https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nasdaq-qmco/quantum/news/quantum-qmco-examining-valuation-after-financial-restatement\">to restate their earnings</a> <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250428860927/en/Evolv-Technology-Completes-Restatement-of-Previously-Issued-Financial-Statements-and-Reports-Third-Quarter-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Financial-Results\">after their financial statements</a> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/discover-financial-services-to-restate-sec-filings-on-credit-card-misclassification-c7ead7f1?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAhVGxgVgu8vNzSQNDZR9Sa6pgPc6vxFZ1AMBgIUSWypD2QYIXnIezy6S3L8exQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d315dd&amp;gaa_sig=VQSQpHJ97axoVXr6iYUK63DFmupDck-pAQqqvonDKHGWIsTL1nWE_BPl8p_T7Mfk0ylmwPHvCp3v2IxYLT3xEw%3D%3D\">didn’t add up</a>. These scandals shake investor trust, trigger sharp drops in company stock and often lead to the chief financial officer’s departure – with some CEOs following suit.</p>\n\n<p>However, while cooking the books is considered a severe form of corporate misconduct, our research suggests that it has fewer job-ending repercussions for CEOs than personal scandals do. Roughly half of all CEOs implicated in financial scandals survive, we found – because, unlike in personal scandals, CEOs can often shift blame. </p>\n\n<p>We also found that CEOs dismissed due to financial scandals tend to be replaced with outside candidates, which has been shown to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(87)90065-1\">stabilize a company’s stock price</a> and lead to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-405X(88)90053-0\">stronger long-term performance</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It might be surprising to learn that a CEO’s personal misconduct can come at a greater cost – both to the business and the executive – than outright financial fraud. Is corporate America overestimating the importance of CEOs’ private behavior? Or is it underestimating the importance of cooking the books?</p>\n\n<p>While I don’t have answers to these questions, I think our findings show the need for more discussion – and more research.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265725/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span> I have received funding from Deloitte for a separate project on sociopolitical activism. </span></em></p>",

Sharing jokes, sarcastic quips, ironic memes and witty anecdotes, the advice goes, will make you more likable, ease stress, strengthen teams, spark creativity and even signal leadership potential.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ksUPFN0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">We are</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oQhB8gYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">professors of marketing</a> <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i_7B_84AAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">and management</a> who study humor and workplace dynamics. Our own research – and a growing body of work by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101698\">other scholars</a> – shows that it’s harder to be funny than most people think. The downside of cracking a bad joke is often larger than what you might gain by landing a good one.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to tell sidesplitting jokes to make humor work for you. You can learn to think like a comedian instead.</p>\n\n<h2>Humor is risky business</h2>\n\n<p>Comedy works by bending and breaking norms – and when those rules aren’t broken in just the right way, it’s more likely to harm your reputation than to help your team.</p>\n\n<p>We developed the “<a href=\"https://humorresearchlab.com/benign-violation-theory/\">benign violation theory</a>” to explain what makes things funny – and why attempts at humor so often backfire, especially in the workplace. Essentially, humor arises when something is both wrong and OK at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>People find jokes funny when they break rules while seeming harmless. Miss one of those ingredients when you tell a joke and your audience won’t appreciate it. When it’s all benign and there’s no violation, you get yawns. When it’s all violation and not benign, you could end up triggering outrage. </p>\n\n<p>It’s hard enough to get laughs in the darkness of a comedy club. Under fluorescent office lights, that razor-thin line becomes even harder to walk. What feels wrong but OK to one colleague can feel simply wrong to another, especially across differences in seniority, culture, gender or even the mood they’re in. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PhGe50BXb2M?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">The hit sitcom ‘The Office’ pokes fun at the cringeworthy jokes cracked by a hapless boss.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>An advertising study</h2>\n\n<p>In our experiments, when everyday people are asked to “be funny,” most attempts land flat or cross lines.</p>\n\n<p>In a humorous caption contest with business students, described in Peter McGraw’s book on global humor practices, “<a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/books/the-humor-code/\">The Humor Code</a>,” the captions weren’t particularly funny to begin with. However, the ones that were rated by judges as the most funny were often also rated the most distasteful. </p>\n\n<p>Being funny without being offensive is of paramount importance. This is particularly true for women, as a robust literature shows women face harsher backlash than men for behavior seen as offensive or norm-violating such as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02079.x\">expressing anger</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2011.10.008\">acting dominantly</a> or even “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2006.09.001\">making asks</a>” in negotiations. </p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_s8CUzXQ4G0?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Don’t be that guy.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>You might end up getting no respect</h2>\n\n<p>Research by other scholars who examine leader and manager behavior in organizations tells a similar story. </p>\n\n<p>In one study, managers who used humor effectively were <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000079\">seen as more confident and competent</a>, boosting their status. Yet when their attempts misfired, those same managers lost status and credibility. Other <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.copsyc.2023.101698\">researchers have found</a> that failed humor doesn’t just hurt a manager’s status – it also makes employees less likely to respect that manager, seek their advice, or trust their leadership.</p>\n\n<p>Even when jokes land, humor can backfire. In <a href=\"https://www.msi.org/working-papers/when-humor-backfires-revisiting-the-relationship-between-humorous-marketing-and-brand-attitude/\">one study</a>, marketing students instructed to write “funny” copy for advertisements wrote ads that were funnier, but also less effective, than students instructed to write “creative” or “persuasive” copy.</p>\n\n<p>Another study found that bosses who joke too often <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5465/amj.2022.0195\">push employees into pretending to be amused</a>, which drains energy, reduces job satisfaction and increases burnout. And the <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/03/making-jokes-during-a-presentation-helps-men-but-hurts-women\">risks are higher for women</a> due to a double standard. When women use humor in presentations, they are often judged as being less capable and having lower status than men.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line is that telling a great joke rarely gets you a promotion. And cracking a bad one can jeopardize your job – even if you’re <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abc-suspends-jimmy-kimmel-live-over-kimmels-charlie-kirk-comments/\">not a talk show host</a> who earns a living making people laugh.</p>\n\n<h2>Flip the script</h2>\n\n<p>Instead of trying to be funny on the job, we recommend that you focus on what we call “thinking funny” – as described in another of McGraw’s books, “<a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/books/shtick-to-business/\">Shtick to Business</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>“The best ideas come as jokes,” <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/233814-the-best-ideas-come-as-jokes-make-your-thinking-as\">advertising legend David Ogilvy once said</a>. “Try to make your thinking as funny as possible.”</p>\n\n<p>But Ogilvy wasn’t telling executives to crack jokes in meetings. He was encouraging employees to think like comedians by flipping expectations, leveraging their networks and finding their niche.</p>\n\n<p>Comics often lead you one way and then flip the script. Comedian Henny Youngman, a master of one-liners, <a href=\"https://www.quotationspage.com/quote/1054.html\">famously quipped</a>, “When I read about the dangers of drinking, I gave up … reading.” The business version of this convention is to challenge an obvious assumption.</p>\n\n<p>For example, Patagonia’s “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaign, which the outdoor gear company rolled out Black Friday in 2011 as a full-page ad in The New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/070715/success-patagonias-marketing-strategy.asp\">paradoxically boosted sales</a> by calling out overconsumption.</p>\n\n<p>To apply this method, pick a stale assumption your team holds, such as that adding features to a product always improves it or that having more meetings will lead to smoother coordination, and ask, “What if the opposite were true?” </p>\n\n<p>You’ll discover options that standard brainstorming misses.</p>\n\n<h2>Create a chasm</h2>\n\n<p>When comedian <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2018/05/bill-burr-in-conversation.html\">Bill Burr has his fans in stitches</a>, he knows some people won’t find his jokes funny – and he doesn’t try to win them over. </p>\n\n<p>We’ve observed that many of the best comics don’t try to please everyone. They succeed by deliberately narrowing their audience. And we also find that businesses that do the same build stronger brands.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when Nebraska’s tourism board embraced “<a href=\"https://visitnebraska.com/press-releases/nebraska-tourism-launches-springsummer-campaign-nebraska-honestly-its-not-everyone\">Honestly, it’s not for everyone</a>” in a 2019 campaign, targeting out-of-state visitors, web traffic jumped 43%.</p>\n\n<p>Some people want hot tea. Others want iced tea. Serving warm tea satisfies no one. Likewise, you can succeed in business by deciding whom your idea is for, and whom it’s not for, then tailoring your product, policy or presentation accordingly.</p>\n\n<h2>Cooperate to innovate</h2>\n\n<p>Stand-up may look like a solo act. But comics depend on feedback – punch-ups from fellow comedians and reactions from audiences – iterating jokes in the same way lean startups may innovate new products.</p>\n\n<p>Building successful teams at work means listening before speaking, making your partners look good, and balancing roles. Improv teacher <a href=\"https://petermcgraw.org/talking-pirates-and-robots-with-billy-merritt/\">Billy Merritt has described</a> three types of improvisers. Pirates are risk-takers. Robots are structure builders. Ninjas are adept at both, taking risks and building structures.</p>\n\n<p>A team designing a new app, for instance, needs all three: Pirates to propose bold features, robots to streamline the interface, and ninjas to bridge gaps. Empowering everyone in these roles leads to braver ideas with fewer blind spots.</p>\n\n<h2>Gifts aren’t universal</h2>\n\n<p>Telling someone to “be funny” is like telling them to “be musical.” Many of us can keep a beat, but few have what it takes to become rock stars. </p>\n\n<p>That’s why we argue that it’s smarter to think like a comedian than to try to act like one.</p>\n\n<p>By reversing assumptions, cooperating to innovate, and creating chasms, professionals can generate fresh solutions and stand out – without becoming an office punchline.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265036/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>The authors do not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and have disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

Indeed, for us the puzzle was why they had flourished in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>To examine their rise and fall, we <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70000\">recently conducted a research project</a> that encompassed interviews with more than 80 executives from various financial institutions, activist organizations and oil and gas companies. </p>\n\n<h2>Powerful allies grasped climate risks</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/\">Net-Zero Banking Alliance</a> was founded in 2021. Members agreed to limit lending to carbon-intense sectors so that total greenhouse gas emissions from companies in the banks’ loan portfolios are close to zero by 2050. </p>\n\n<p>This target aligned with the goals of the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">Paris Agreement</a> but was not binding and lacked clear shorter-term targets and plans. Similar net-zero networks were established for insurance, asset management and other financial areas, all under the umbrella of the <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/\">United Nations Environment Program’s Finance Initiative</a>. Over the past 16 months, the <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-pauses-activities/\">insurance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ipe.com/news/net-zero-asset-managers-initiative-halts-activities/10128152.article\">asset managers’</a> alliances have also suspended their activities.</p>\n\n<p>These net-zero alliances were built on the <a href=\"https://iacpm.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IACPM-Oliver-Wyman-2018-Study-on-Climate-Risk-Awareness-White-Paper.pdf?\">premise that climate risk equals financial risk</a> and that the challenge requires a collective response. Their goal was to leverage the power of finance to push companies to decarbonize their products and processes.</p>\n\n<p>Key financial regulators, central banks and a few of the largest asset managers propelled these alliances because they perceived that climate change poses serious long-term systemic risks to markets and economies around the world. Influential figures such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b57ece-0c31-4f42-9229-c8981bc9fd34\">Larry Fink</a>, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, and former <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/speech/2015/breaking-the-tragedy-of-the-horizon-climate-change-and-financial-stability.pdf\">Bank of England head Mark Carney</a>, now the prime minister of Canada, lent legitimacy to these initiatives. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ceres.org/banking\">Some environmental groups</a> also supported these alliances as a smart strategy to pressure companies on climate. Many other financial institutions then joined the net-zero bandwagon, but our research revealed that they didn’t do so because of concern about climate-related financial risks. Rather, they felt an array of pressure from peers, investors, activists, regulators and even their families. </p>\n\n<p>Many people we interviewed mentioned reputational risk as a key driver and saw a low-carbon transition as inevitable, driven by regulation, technological innovation and consumer demand. This was the Biden era, with billions of dollars flowing to clean energy through the <a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28112024/clean-energy-inflation-reduction-act-uncertainty/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The burgeoning field also spawned a specialized but lucrative industry of data providers and consultants who actively marketed carbon management, disclosure and broader sustainability services. The <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/esg-software-market-report\">global market for sustainability data and software</a> was estimated at more than US$1 billion in 2024 and growing rapidly. </p>\n\n<p>Climate strategy and sustainability reporting was the fastest-growing business sector for <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/sustainability-consulting-services-market\">accounting and consulting firms</a>. And asset managers were happy to collect <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-05-07/many-esg-funds-are-just-expensive-s-p-500-indexers?\">higher fees for funds screened for sustainability</a> – even though these funds have not outperformed the broader market.</p>\n\n<p>These vested interests spurred continued expansion of net-zero networks. Indeed, at its peak in 2024, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-pauses-activities/\">included over 140 members globally</a> with $74 trillion in estimated total assets, representing over 40% of global banking assets. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"wind turbine components await assembly on a pier in connecticut\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692537/original/file-20250923-64-62dha8.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The Trump administration has canceled several offshore wind farm projects, such as one that’s nearly complete and intended to serve Rhode Island and Connecticut – though its fate is still in court.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/ClimateTrumpOffshoreWind/2f899d8d10c14eca8cc5f322a8c94c33/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Political backlash</h2>\n\n<p>Given the size and scope of these net-zero networks, what triggered their rapid collapse? </p>\n\n<p>One major factor, of course, was the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/leonard-leo-consumers-research-esg-climate/683581/\">political backlash</a> against anything connected with climate action and sustainable investing following the 2024 election of President Donald Trump.</p>\n\n<p>Finance <a href=\"https://www.esgdive.com/news/state-gop-finance-officials-press-us-asset-managers-denounce-esg-climate-blackrock-vanguard-jpmorgan/756716/\">officials in more than 20 U.S. states</a> have demanded that major asset managers restrict the use of environment, social and governance benchmarks, accusing them of eroding “traditional fiduciary duty” and claiming they hurt investors.</p>\n\n<p>In August, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/republican-attorneys-general-accuse-net-zero-standards-setters-of-running-climate-cartel-5893d34e?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\">23 Republican attorneys general</a> accused organizations created to set standards for corporate climate disclosures of operating an anticompetitive “climate cartel”  and violating antitrust laws.</p>\n\n<h2>Fossil fuels – too lucrative to abandon</h2>\n\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/republicans-anti-esg-attack-may-be-silencing-insurers-but-it-isnt-changing-their-pro-climate-business-decisions-206922\">political pressure in the U.S.</a> has indeed been intense, the <a href=\"https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/blackrock-exit-net-zero-asset-managers-suspends-activities\">collapse of net-zero networks</a> and the broader <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-corporate-climate-broken-promises/?embedded-checkout=true\">corporate retreat from climate commitments</a> is largely due to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aebdb5ac-7e97-425e-8af3-e086488255c5\">continued profitability of fossil fuels</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/FP_20210623_industrial_gross_v2.pdf\">high costs and risks of deep decarbonization</a>. Investors and banks, of course, want to keep on financing profitable companies and avoid pressuring their clients to take risky measures. </p>\n\n<p>Oil companies such as BP and Shell that had relatively <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/christianstadler/2024/04/30/shell-is-paying-the-price-for-sustainability-while-exxon-profits-soar/?\">strong climate targets suffered financially</a> as a result, prompting them to retreat from these targets and <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/91253071/bp-shell-backtracked-climate-goals-2024-heres-why\">shift capital</a> from renewable projects back toward fossil fuels. <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55020\">High energy prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war</a> made the sector even more lucrative. Low-carbon fuels and processes for industries such as aviation, steel and cement are <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/insights/industry-and-buildings/the-cost-of-decarbonizing-industry-is-high-but-within-reach/?\">still very expensive</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the Trump administration is abolishing most <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-trump-administration-and-congress-attacks-on-wind-power-are-killing-thousands-of-jobs-and-risk-thousands-more/?\">subsidies for clean energy and freezing permits for offshore wind</a>, while easing regulations and opening more land for oil and gas exploration. </p>\n\n<p>These economic incentives made it hard for the banking alliance to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/commodities/oil-gas-companies-continue-to-find-financing\">reduce financing for fossil fuels</a> – and <a href=\"https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BOCC_2025_FINAL4.pdf\">the money has kept on flowing</a> into oil and gas projects.</p>\n\n<p>European banks that sharply cut funding to fossil fuel companies saw their <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51662-6\">business diverted to other banks</a> and to <a href=\"https://www.akingump.com/a/web/vXurKbioYj87DzhQCgcQ47/trends-in-oil-and-gas-2025-akin-pdf-v6.pdf\">private, nonbank sources of finance</a>, which has soared in the past two years. Facing this loss of business, major banks’ <a href=\"https://www.bankingonclimatechaos.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BOCC_2025_FINAL4.pdf\">lending to oil and gas companies surged</a> in 2024, driving loans to a three-year high of $869 billion.</p>\n\n<p><iframe id=\"lywCa\" class=\"tc-infographic-datawrapper\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lywCa/2/\" height=\"400px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: 0;\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The costs of membership in the net-zero alliances also increased over time, with the adoption of <a href=\"https://esgnews.com/net-zero-banking-alliance-tightens-guidelines-for-banks-climate-targets/\">stricter standards</a> that called for specific plans and timelines for ending fossil fuel financing entirely. The new standards also required loan recipients to <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/scope-3-emissions-top-supply-chain-sustainability-challenges?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">disclose Scope 3 emissions</a>, which include emissions from a company’s suppliers and customers.</p>\n\n<p>Managers in financial institutions told us that the increasingly complex and demanding requirements were generating strong pushback from their clients. We also heard that membership was turning from a reputational asset to a liability, as <a href=\"https://beyond-coal.jp/en/documents/bocc2025/\">activist organizations called out the hypocrisy</a> of continued fossil fuel lending despite their commitments to phasing it out.</p>\n\n<h2>Ignoring climate change’s long-term risks</h2>\n\n<p>Although banks are rushing back to finance fossil fuel projects, these loans typically have long terms of 10 to 25 years. This means they carry the risk that an eventual transition to clean energy will make these projects <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2022/699532/IPOL_STU%282022%29699532_EN.pdf?\">worthless, “stranded assets</a>.” One study <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-022-01356-y\">estimates that investors</a> are currently exposed to more than $1 trillion in potential losses. </p>\n\n<p>Why do banks often ignore these risks? </p>\n\n<p><div inline-promo-placement=\"editor\"></div></p>\n\n<p>Our interviewees mentioned the organizational silos that separate analysts who assess climate risks from the loan originators. In other words, the employees deciding where to lend money may not be talking to the team that best understands the long-term risks. Moreover, current risk assessment tools are quite crude and don’t generate the quantitative metrics that loan underwriters want.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4276781\">loans are increasingly repackaged and sold</a>, or securitized, into the larger corporate debt market, obscuring the risks. </p>\n\n<h2>Climate risks are real and growing</h2>\n\n<p>The Net-Zero Banking Alliance isn’t disappearing entirely. The group is currently <a href=\"https://www.unepfi.org/net-zero-banking/media/nzba-update-august-2025/\">deciding on whether to restructure</a> into a much weaker “framework initiative” that provides voluntary guidance instead of binding commitments. </p>\n\n<p>And some banks leaving the alliance have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/net-zero-banking-alliance-suspends-activities-amid-wave-of-departures-fc1beef1?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">stated that they will maintain their climate goals</a> and sustainability policies.</p>\n\n<p>But climate risks are real and growing. The <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/press/11december2024-climate-risk-cost-of-inaction\">Boston Consulting Group recently estimated</a> that just the physical risks – floods, drought and wildfires – could cost companies up to 25% of their profits by 2050 and substantially cut global GDP. </p>\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/climate-transition-impact-framework-ctif-planning-for-a-sustainable-and-inclusive-future#/\">transition to a low-carbon economy</a> will cost trillions of dollars and create massive disruption – as well as opportunities – as new technologies and companies emerge. The longer that action is delayed, the greater the risks to the planet – and of more drastic shocks to the global economy and financial system.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265176/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>David L Levy receives funding from the BSF, the Bi-national  US-Israel Science Foundation</span></em></p><p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Rami Kaplan receives funding from the BSF, the Bi-national US-Israel Science Foundation</span></em></p>",

And what would a U.S. bailout of Argentina look like? For answers, The Conversation turned to <a href=\"https://arturo.porzecanski.com/\">Arturo Porzecanski</a>, an expert on Latin American economies at American University.</em></p>\n\n<h2>Why is the Argentine government seeking a bail out?</h2>\n\n<p>The event that sparked discussion of U.S. intervention was a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2025/09/22/argentinas-finances-just-got-even-more-surreal\">sharp sell-off of the Argentine currency</a>, the peso, as well as the country’s stocks and bonds.</p>\n\n<p>Over the course of three days ending on Sept. 19, the country’s central bank <a href=\"https://buenosairesherald.com/economics/milei-says-argentina-in-very-advanced-negotiations-over-loan-from-us\">spent over $1 billion</a> of its hard-currency reserves defending the Argentine peso from further depreciation. To be sure, instead of dialing up his contacts in the Trump administration, Milei could have allowed the currency to find its market-clearing value – that is, the price at which supply and demand match.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, he could have kept up the effort to stabilize the peso by spending still more billions of dollars previously borrowed from the International Monetary Fund. </p>\n\n<p>However, he decided to call Washington and ask for financial support, hoping that the <a href=\"https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/argentina/trump-and-milei-an-ideological-match-but-can-they-work-together.phtml\">friendship with Trump</a> he has been cultivating from even before Milei was elected would finally pay off.</p>\n\n<p>The Argentine authorities fear that a sharper depreciation will reignite expectations of high inflation, and they also wish to conserve those IMF funds to help cover nearly $20 billion in interest and principal payments on dollar debts coming due in the next 15 months. The Argentine government would also rather not have the central bank raise interest rates by tightening monetary policy still more, nor implement additional cuts in government spending given that the economy is <a href=\"https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/one-of-the-most-prestigious-financial-research-centres-warns-that-a-new-recession-is-almost-inevitable.phtml\">either stagnant or already in a recession</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Argentina’s economy got here because prior to Milei taking office in December 2023, his predecessor <a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/money-still-matters-case-argentina\">applied very loose monetary and fiscal policies</a> – such as keeping interest rates low and spending high to stimulate the economy – as well as business-unfriendly regulations. That rocketed <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-cpi\">annual inflation into triple digits</a> and led to the crumbling of confidence among domestic and foreign investors, thus complicating the government’s ability to refinance its maturing debt obligations.</p>\n\n<p>While Milei reversed many of those harmful policies during the course of 2024, notably achieving a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-draft-2026-budget-spotlights-fiscal-balance-hikes-social-allocations-2025-09-16/\">balanced government budget</a> and a sharp deceleration of inflation, his popular support and confidence in his ability to manage the country’s remaining challenges have weakened in recent months.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"A woman casts a vote into a box.\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/692748/original/file-20250924-56-hhvd77.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Argentine voters handed President Javier Milei a political blow in legislative elections on Sept. 7, 2025.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/voter-cast-his-vote-at-a-polling-station-during-legislative-news-photo/2234188059?adppopup=true\">Tobias Skarlovnik/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>The economy has stalled, with <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/argentina-is-losing-faith-in-mileis-free-market-revolution-9475ba42?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgc4O3dRGtXsbRn32126juu_jtoH9gkshoyU6011w__PQqEXEcnJlwM8hw20tg%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68d421f5&amp;gaa_sig=TfO458L3DYEksxqzvmrNOHVjn00uy_-Y0YkeklEvMWJT59jbChDvy3sDVF_DxSHfYbwtvHSfiUD_tXesMrNC9Q%3D%3D\">job losses and unemployment rising</a>. Phone recordings suggesting corruption involving the president’s family were released. And Milei’s party did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/argentina-election-javier-milei\">surprisingly poorly in recent elections</a> that took place in the large province of Buenos Aires. With midterm congressional elections scheduled for Oct. 26, Milei badly needs political and financial support from the Trump administration in order to stabilize the local financial markets and project a sense of order.</p>\n\n<h2>What options are there for the US to help Argentina?</h2>\n\n<p>The U.S. government has already been unusually supportive of Argentina from its dominant positions on the board of directors of the IMF, World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. Earlier this year, it helped the country to secure from them pledges and disbursements worth tens of billions of dollars in new loans.</p>\n\n<p>What is very new and different now is the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-treasury-chief-us-ready-support-argentina-leaders-meet-tuesday-2025-09-22/\">direct lending from the U.S. Treasury</a> to the government of Argentina. As previewed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sept. 24, his team is currently in negotiations with their counterparts in Argentina for a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-24/bessent-says-us-negotiating-20-billion-swap-line-with-argentina\">$20 billion swap line</a>, which presumably would involve the Treasury’s temporary purchase of Argentine pesos in exchange for the delivery of U.S. dollars. This could possibly be supplemented by the Treasury’s temporary purchase of Argentine government bonds, likely payable in dollars, whether newly issued or already in circulation.  </p>\n\n<p>Bessent’s announcement, coming on the heels of Trump’s vow to help out his Argentine counterpart, has prompted local and foreign investors to regain confidence in Argentina, such that beaten-up stocks and bonds have <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-markets-soar-after-us-bessent-pledges-support-2025-09-22/\">bounced back</a> and the currency has appreciated.</p>\n\n<p>This immediate and enthusiastic market response, if sustained, means that the Treasury may not have to spend too many billions of U.S. dollars to boost public confidence in Milei and Argentina, at least until the upcoming midterm elections. </p>\n\n<p>Should Milei’s party do well in the late-October contest, enabling it to gain seats in the House and Senate and thus have more political support in the national legislature, a relatively small and temporary investment may yield a worthwhile payoff for the Trump and Milei administrations. </p>\n\n<h2>Why is the US keen on helping out?</h2>\n\n<p>Normally the U.S. government does not involve itself directly in foreign bailouts unless a country is systemically important – namely, when its troubles affect its neighbors, a number of other countries, or the United States itself.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the 1990s the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/government-financial-bailout.asp\">offered direct support</a> to other countries during crises in Mexico, East Asia and Russia, and in 1995 Argentina was one of the beneficiaries. And in 2008, in the wake of the global financial crisis, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/24/business/feds-aid-in-2008-crisis-stretched-worldwide.html\">Fed made available dollars in exchange for the currencies</a> of about a dozen foreign countries – currency swaps mainly with European countries but also with Brazil, Canada and Mexico, since the meltdown affected Washington’s North American neighbors and many nations in Europe.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, in most cases, whatever Treasury or Fed funding is made available is soon repaid by upcoming loans from institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, or else by major banks or institutional investors. In other words, most U.S. official support has been of the “bridge lending” kind, because the Treasury and the Fed can act within days, whereas other financial actors require weeks or even months to approve and disburse funding.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Argentina, it is notable that Bessent has stated that Argentina is systemically important, even though its troubles have so far not affected any other country. Left unsaid is how Argentina would repay the U.S. Treasury, because the pipeline of upcoming disbursements from official international organizations is not very large.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the funds under discussion are not clear bridges to anything. In similar circumstances in the past, the U.S. Treasury has sought payment guarantees from foreign governments. Given the transactional approach favored by Trump, certain conditions may be demanded from Argentina – a country endowed with lithium, rare earths, shale oil and other resources.</p>\n\n<h2>What is the US Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund?</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/exchange-stabilization-fund\">Exchange Stabilization Fund</a> is the Treasury’s crisis-funding vehicle through which the bridging loan to prop up the Argentine currency would be made.</p>\n\n<p>The fund was established in the mid-1930s. It was endowed with the profits that the U.S. Treasury realized when the official price of gold rose from $20.67 to $35 per ounce, increasing the value of U.S. government gold holdings.</p>\n\n<p>For several decades through the 1980s, namely before the U.S. currency was allowed to float freely, the fund’s main purpose was to provide the funding for Treasury operations to affect the price of the dollar. A secondary purpose was to provide short-term, government-to-government loans mainly to Latin American countries, yet starting in the mid-1990s this became its primary objective.</p>\n\n<p>The last Exchange Stabilization Fund loan was <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/po3345\">granted to Uruguay in mid-2002</a>, in the wake of a major financial crisis in next-door Argentina that had triggered a bank run in Uruguay – and threatened to spread elsewhere around the region. The Treasury sent $1.5 million to Uruguay on a Monday to back at least the government-owned banks, and the funds were returned to Washington that same Friday. The bank run was stopped and thus <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/js2250#:%7E:text=The%20U.S.%20Treasury%20provided%20a,percent%20of%20GDP%20in%202004.\">the loan succeeded magnificently</a>.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265924/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Arturo Porzecanski does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

But not every “new” drug is truly new.</p>\n\n<p>Patents are designed to reward breakthrough inventions by granting the inventors temporary monopoly rights to recoup the costs of research and development and to <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/patent-system-often-stifles-the-innovation-it-was-designed-to-encourage-148075\">encourage future innovation</a>. But firms may also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.01.004\">exploit the system</a> in ways that make drugs more expensive and less accessible to patients. A 2023 study found that <a href=\"https://yalelawandpolicy.org/patent-term-extensions-and-last-man-standing\">78% of drugs</a> associated with new patents weren’t actually new drugs but minor modifications.</p>\n\n<p>After obtaining a drug’s primary patent, pharmaceutical companies often file additional ones to extend their monopoly rights. This practice – <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2012.01.004\">called evergreening</a> – may cover new dosages, delivery methods, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhealeco.2022.102671\">drug combinations</a> and conditions. Though some of these secondary patents improve the effectiveness or convenience of treatment, many have little effect on health outcomes. More often, these subsequent changes are mainly used to strategically <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pharmas-expensive-gaming-of-the-drug-patent-system-is-successfully-countered-by-the-medicines-patent-pool-which-increases-global-access-and-rewards-innovation-189868\">prolong market exclusivity</a>, delay competition from generics and keep drug prices high.</p>\n\n<p>Such practices raise concerns about drug access and affordability, especially when companies use minor tweaks to block cheaper alternatives, with little benefit to patients. Yet distinguishing between truly innovative improvements and low-value extensions has been <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20200703\">challenging for regulators and courts</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lucyxiaoluwang.com/\">I am an economist</a> studying <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M0QlVjcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">innovation and digitization in health care markets</a>. My colleague <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Nzez8GgAAAAJ\">Dennis Byrski</a> and I have focused on how regulatory transparency plays a role in curbing weak patents. Our recently published research found that when clinical trial data become public, this <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105415\">disclosure makes it harder</a> for firms to obtain patents for incremental changes that add little therapeutic benefit for patients.</p>\n\n<h2>What makes a drug patentable?</h2>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/en/web/patents/protection\">World Intellectual Property Organization</a>, a patentable invention needs to be <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/essentials\">novel and non-obvious</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Novelty means the invention hasn’t been previously documented in publicly available information – such as patents, publications or products – in fields related to an invention before the filing date. This information is often referred to as <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/learning/learning-resources-profile/business-and-ip-managers/inventors-handbook/novelty-and-prior-art\">prior art</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_vii_4.html\">Non-obviousness</a> means the invention wouldn’t be obvious – an easy tweak or routine step in the process – to a <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_vii_3.html\">skilled person in the field</a> based on existing knowledge. For example, if prior art reveals that a <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/pharmas-expensive-gaming-of-the-drug-patent-system-is-successfully-countered-by-the-medicines-patent-pool-which-increases-global-access-and-rewards-innovation-189868\">new combination therapy</a> improves treatment outcomes, officials may deem subsequent patents using the same drug cocktail as obvious and refuse to grant or enforce the patent.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-zZFOUa7Vw?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Pharmaceutical companies game the patent system to maintain their monopoly on a drug.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For drugs, these two concepts are deeply intertwined with safety and efficacy. If a company reformulates a drug – say, by changing an inactive ingredient or tweaking the dose – it is not always easy to determine whether such changes improve patient health without further testing in the clinic. </p>\n\n<p>According to guidelines from the European Patent Office, <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/legal/guidelines-epc/2024/g_vi_6_1.html\">clinical trial results can be critical</a> to prior art, particularly when revealing unexpected or previously undisclosed therapeutic benefits. Patent advisers have also noted that evidence from trials can <a href=\"https://www.kilburnstrode.com/knowledge/european-ip/clinical-trials-novelty\">play a decisive role</a> in assessing novelty and non-obviousness.</p>\n\n<p>However, comprehensive clinical trial results are often either unavailable or not disclosed until the start of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/tools/health-products-regulation-and-prequalification-learning-catalogue/registration-and-marketing-authorization\">marketing authorization process</a>, when a company submits a comprehensive application to regulators to formally approve a drug for sale. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, while European drug regulators strongly encourage companies to <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory-overview/research-development/clinical-trials-human-medicines/clinical-trials-regulation\">disclose clinical trial data</a> early in the process, firms can defer the release of study data for <a href=\"https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/other/revised-ctis-transparency-rules_en.pdf\">up to seven years</a> after trial completion or until the drug goes on the market – whichever occurs first. The latter is more binding for firms wishing to delay the release of critical data points to avoid competition.</p>\n\n<h2>Marketing authorization changes the game</h2>\n\n<p>Given the <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/90-of-drugs-fail-clinical-trials-heres-one-way-researchers-can-select-better-drug-candidates-174152\">lengthy drug development process</a>, most firms file the primary patent of a drug early on, often before starting clinical trials and obtaining data on treatment safety and efficacy. </p>\n\n<p>This information is required when applying for <a href=\"https://toolkit.ncats.nih.gov/glossary/marketing-authorization/\">marketing authorization</a> and is usually disclosed through detailed Phase 3 clinical trial results. That data can then become prior art to evaluate subsequent patent applications, making it harder to obtain low-value patents. But does marketing authorization actually affect whether drug companies pursue follow-on patents?</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"Timeline of drug development and patenting process in Europe, extending over 25 years\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=223&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=223&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=223&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=280&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=280&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691489/original/file-20250917-66-k8s40i.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=280&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">The drug development and marketing process can be lengthy.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105415\">Dennis Byrski and Lucy Xiaolu Wang</a>, <a class=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\">CC BY-NC-ND</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>To investigate how patenting behaviors change after marketing authorization, we specifically used data from the <a href=\"https://www.dpma.de/english/search/dpmaregister/index.html\">German Patent and Trade Mark Office</a> and the European Patent Office’s <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/searching-for-patents/business/patstat\">Worldwide Patent Statistical Database</a>. Legal and innovation <a href=\"https://www.epo.org/en/news-events/news/epo-remains-gold-standard-patent-quality\">scholars worldwide</a> often view the European agency as the <a href=\"https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/arzjl50\">gold standard for patent quality</a>, and scholars use European drug patents as <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257/pol.20200703\">high-quality benchmarks</a> when evaluating U.S. drug patents. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the U.S. has seen <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/101-Report_FINAL.pdf\">four major Supreme Court cases</a> involving patent eligibility between 2010 and 2014, including two <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/566/66/\">focused on the</a> <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/569/576/\">pharmaceutical sector</a>. The European setting allowed us to study changes in patenting behavior in the absence of direct legal changes to the patent system.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying primary patents isn’t easy. Because they often aren’t labeled in drug patent databases, researchers often need to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049470\">manually review lengthy patent texts</a> for U.S. drugs. We overcome this difficulty by tracking <a href=\"https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/strategy/intellectual-property/patent-protection-eu/supplementary-protection-certificates-pharmaceutical-and-plant-protection-products_en\">supplementary protection certificates</a> granted by the European patent term extension system. This system requires companies to specify which main drug patent to extend after marketing authorization and before patent expiration.</p>\n\n<p>We found that <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105415\">disclosing prior art</a> – such as existing knowledge from clinical trial data – during marketing authorization makes it harder to obtain low-value, follow-on patents afterward. This was reflected by a sharp drop in self-citations from subsequent patents for that drug and other patents with similar disease targets. </p>\n\n<p>In contrast, subsequent self-citations from substantive product patents – such as those for new drug derivatives – and patents targeting different disease areas <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105415\">continue at roughly the same pace</a> as before marketing authorization.</p>\n\n<p>These findings suggest that transparency in the authorization process effectively deters companies from obtaining low-value patent extensions without discouraging further research and development. </p>\n\n<p>Importantly, we saw <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105415\">similar patenting adjustments</a> among the patent owner’s competitors, collaborators and generic manufacturers. This pattern suggests that changes in patenting behaviors may not be driven by reduced profit-seeking after drug approval, as other firms would have a higher motivation to obtain related weak patents after seeing a drug’s market potential. Once clinical trial data is public, this seems to have a systemwide effect on reducing low-value, follow-on patents, likely driven by a higher bar for novelty.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, we didn’t see similar declines in patent filings after earlier milestones in the drug development process, such as the end of Phase 2 clinical trials. These milestones provide information on drug quality but involve less data disclosure, so they’re less likely to provide usable prior art for patent examiners. </p>\n\n<p>In other words, it’s the full clinical transparency at marketing authorization that makes a big difference.</p>\n\n<h2>What this means for patients and policymakers</h2>\n\n<p>Drug patent quality matters. Weak patents can drive up drug costs and delay access by blocking competition from generics long after the market has rewarded a company for its main innovation. The results can be costly for patients, insurers and public health systems, and it risks steering R&amp;D toward marginal tweaks instead of breakthrough therapies.</p>\n\n<p>Our findings suggest that integrating regulatory information, including clinical trial data, into patent assessments can indirectly improve patent quality. Doing so can reduce the number of weak drug patents filed more for strategic considerations rather than improving patient health.</p>\n\n<p>Better aligning patents with genuine innovation is not just a legal concern but a public health imperative. Transparency, paired with smarter review systems, can help raise the bar for drug development and reward the kinds of innovations that truly improve health.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258989/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Lucy Xiaolu Wang does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",

      "author": "Danielle Hass, Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Marketing, West Virginia University",
      "content": "<p>I was one of the millions of people who lost someone to <a href=\"https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths\">the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. Despite the nonstop news about the “new normal,” my grief felt invisible. I took shallow solace in my phone and turned to social media to numb me from the reality that I now lived in: a world without my dad. </p>\n\n<p>One day, while mindlessly scrolling, I came across the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/squishmallow/\">r/Squishmallow</a> subreddit, where a girl had posted her collection of more than 100 round plush toys. They were called Squishmallows – round stuffed animals invented in 2017 that have become one of the most popular toy lines in the world, with <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/02/how-toy-sensation-squishmallows-joined-warren-buffetts-conglomerate.html\">more than 100 million sold each year</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I was hypnotized. I expected that my dive into <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/66173748\">the Squishmallow phenomenon</a> would be the usual two-hour rabbit hole, but spending time in that community was the first joy I’d felt in months.</p>\n\n<p>After scrolling through endless photos of Squishmallow hauls, I worked up the courage to post. I asked if there was a cardinal Squishmallow, since that bird was my dad’s symbol for his own father. I was bombarded with compassion; even though cardinal Squishmallows were rare at the time, someone sent me theirs for free. That single act of generosity started my collection.</p>\n\n<h2>Stumbling into the Squishmallow world</h2>\n\n<p>But alongside kindness and joy, I encountered a darker side of the community: resellers. Finding the most coveted Squishmallows could turn into a fierce competition.</p>\n\n<p>This wasn’t just my personal frustration. As a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j3ANDdoAAAAJ&amp;hl=\">doctoral candidate in marketing</a>, I wanted to understand how communities like this function when outsiders exploit their passion for profit. That became the focus of my dissertation — the first study to examine resellers’ psychological and emotional impact on brand communities.</p>\n\n<p>That research – which my colleagues and I published <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2025.115496\">in one of the field’s top journals</a> – echoed what I had lived through as a collector: Resellers are one of the most consistent sources of pain for members of brand communities.</p>\n\n<figure>\n            <iframe width=\"440\" height=\"260\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9dpDEbdVww?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\n            <figcaption><span class=\"caption\">A Squishmallow reseller discusses his technique.</span></figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<p>For example, when I heard that my local Hot Topic would be selling two Reshmas, the coveted <a href=\"https://squishmallowsquad.fandom.com/wiki/Reshma\">strawberry cow Squishmallow</a>, I, like any rational adult, found myself outside of a mall at 6:30 in the morning. When the doors finally opened at 11 a.m., I sprinted to the storefront – only to find that I had been beaten by some people who had dressed as mall employees to sneak in early. I left devastated and cowless.</p>\n\n<p>Later that day, I saw the same people gloating in local Squishmallow Facebook groups, trying to resell the cow for more than 10 times the retail price. I was heartbroken and angry; I swore I’d never collect again. And I wasn’t the only one to feel that way: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/transformers/comments/wmqw7u/honestly_if_youre_a_scalper_i_hope_you_come_to/\">Across social media</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/squishmallow/comments/wkmh5p/im_getting_so_sick_of_resellers/\">you’ll find countless collectors</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/squishmallow/comments/17k21td/please_do_not_buy_from_resellers_for_the_sake_of/\">venting about resellers</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What is a brand community?</h2>\n\n<p>I didn’t know it then, but I had joined my first brand community: a group of consumers who form strong, meaningful connections through their shared admiration of a product. Brand communities range from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/845967007642024\">giant online hubs with more than 100,000 members</a> to tiny local groups that host trading parties in empty lots. </p>\n\n<p>You might be in a brand community without realizing it. These communities can be created by a company – like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/harley-davidson\">Harley-Davidson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LEGO\">Lego</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hotwheels\">Hot Wheels</a> – or emerge organically from fans, like the Facebook group “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/disneytipsandtricks\">Walt Disney World Tips and Tricks</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>And they aren’t just about buying and selling. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/JPBM-01-2020-2705\">They’re creative ecosystems</a>, full of posts showing collections, inventive displays and even goodbye messages when someone “rehomes” an item to another loving collector. Community members help each other solve problems, share leads on hard-to-find items and sometimes even mail strangers a plush toy because they know it will make them smile.</p>\n\n<p>But while collectors use these communities to exchange information, so do resellers.</p>\n\n<h2>The reseller paradox: A shared enemy can unite a community</h2>\n\n<p>Resellers are outsiders who buy the most sought-after items and <a href=\"https://communicationtoday.sk/wp-content/uploads/01_MACAK_SASALOVA_CT-2-2022.pdf\">flip them online for a profit</a>. They scout inventory tips, track hot products and <a href=\"https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2020/11/25/ps5-scalper-group-no-regrets-reselling-3500-consoles-markup/\">plan their shelf-clearing strategies accordingly</a>. And they infuriate collectors like me. Nothing sours the thrill of the hunt faster than seeing a shelf cleared by someone who only wants to use your sacred collectibles for profit.</p>\n\n<p>After feeling emotional pain myself, I wanted to understand why resellers bothered me so much, and what they meant for the communities that had become my lifeline. That frustration became the spark for my research. What I found surprised me.</p>\n\n<p>As a collector, nothing frustrates me more than to say: According to my research, resellers paradoxically strengthen brand communities. Yes, you read that right. Resellers help communities, but not because they try to help members acquire their desired items. In fact, my findings indicate that resellers inflict heartbreak on community members – which was in line with what I saw and experienced. </p>\n\n<p>Resellers help brand communities because they create a common enemy that the community can rally against. When resellers grab all the stock from a store shelf, collectors turn to each other. They vent. They strategize. They share tips on where to find certain items, offer to pick up extras for strangers and organize trades to help each other avoid inflated resale prices. Ironically, the people causing the most frustration also increase community engagement.</p>\n\n<h2>Brand communities are real communities</h2>\n\n<p>These communities reminded me that you are never truly alone in your darkest moments. Joining a niche community, whether for sneakers, trading cards, cars or even Squishmallows, can enrich your life far beyond the products themselves. It wasn’t the Squishmallows that helped me heal from loss; it was the connection that lived in threads, comments and group chats.</p>\n\n<p>I even came to appreciate the “villains” of the community – resellers – for their role in bringing people together.

      "content": "<p>A few years ago, while <a href=\"https://engl.iastate.edu/profiles/jo-mackiewicz/\">working as a professor</a> and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/only-5-3-of-welders-in-the-us-are-women-after-years-as-a-writing-professor-i-became-one-heres-what-i-learned-240431\">as a welder</a> at a small repair and fabrication shop, I went looking for books about women in the skilled trades. In the few I found, one stood out in how it made way for tradeswomen’s voices: political scientist Jean Reith Schroedel’s 1985 classic “<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6wgcpj\">Alone in a Crowd: Women in the Trades Tell Their Stories</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Her first book after earning her Ph.D., “Alone in a Crowd” drew on Schroedel’s own experience working blue-collar jobs. She interviewed 25 women – machinists, truck drivers, electricians and more – whose stories revealed the exhaustion, danger, harassment and pride that shaped their working lives.</p>\n\n<p>In her introduction, Schroedel noted that American women’s work opportunities have expanded and contracted in step with their rights as citizens. During World War II, for example, women entered the industrial trades in large numbers, only to be forced out when the war ended. They began to find their way back to such work after the passage of the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/civil-rights-act\">1964 Civil Rights Act</a>, which barred discrimination based on sex.</p>\n\n<p>The women who entered skilled trades after 1964 made up just <a href=\"https://truthout.org/articles/skilled-women-break-through-barriers-to-entry-and-promotion-in-trades-work/\">a small share of the workforce</a>, and they faced a wide range of challenges, including sexual harassment. Schroedel’s interviewees talked at length about being harassed and threatened by co-workers and being retaliated against for reporting sexism, racism and bullying. </p>\n\n<p>So what, if anything, has changed, and what’s stayed the same?</p>\n\n<h2>Women hold just 5% of jobs in the trades</h2>\n\n<p>For one thing, it’s still rare for women to work in the skilled trades. <a href=\"https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/07/harnessing-talents-women-growing-trades-workforce\">Around 95%</a> of the trades workforce is male, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Discrimination remains a barrier to entry: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01446193.2020.1762906\">A 2020 research review</a> published by sociologist Donna Bridges and her colleagues found that sexual harassment, stereotyping, ostracization and surveillance kept women from entering and staying in construction trades.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37016801/\">a 2023 analysis of 25 studies</a> by Kimberly Riddle and Karen Heaton, sexual harassment of tradeswomen becomes more likely when male workers view women as outsiders, when women have less seniority and when jobs are physically demanding. These issues were common in 1985, and they remain so today.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center zoomable\">\n            <a href=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=450&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/690966/original/file-20250915-56-vimnb7.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=566&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\"></a>\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Heather, a Howe’s employee, working at the lathe in the machine shop.

In a study published in 2022, sociologist Elizabeth Wulff and her colleagues <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1440783321995878\">interviewed 15 tradeswomen</a> and found that types of social and cultural capital, such as growing up in a family of tradespeople and being physically strong, led them to be more successful.</p>\n\n<p>Meraiah Foley, a researcher who studies workplace gender equity, and her co-researchers focused on how tradeswomen experience gender harassment – harassment not sexual in nature but focused on gender characteristics. Studying women in aviation and automotive repair in 2019, they found women experience “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12443\">jokes, jibes, and belittling comments</a>” and bosses who allow such behavior. These behaviors reinforce the view that women are outsiders, making it harder for them to succeed.</p>\n\n<h2>Steps forward: Respect, research and cultural shifts</h2>\n\n<p>So, has anything improved for women in trades since 1985? While the research clearly shows that problems such as stereotyping, disrespect, scrutiny and harassment haven’t gone away, it would be wrong to say that nothing’s changed.</p>\n\n<p>In Chapter 10 of my 2025 book “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-96-3396-8_10\">Learning Skilled Trades in the Workplace</a>,” I discuss some of the challenges that I’ve encountered as a woman in a welding shop. But I also highlight the ways that my boss and my co-workers have respected my ideas and input, have encouraged me when I’ve made mistakes, have praised my successes, and have generously shared their knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>It’s possible to see change in <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/wb/topics/apprenticeships\">apprenticeship programs aimed at girls and women</a>, <a href=\"https://thehourglassfoundation.org/women-rock-trades-scholarship-criteria/\">scholarships for women studying trades</a>, <a href=\"https://tradeswomenbuild.org/tradeswomens-organizations/\">professional organizations</a> to support tradeswomen, and, perhaps most important, <a href=\"https://ntinow.edu/women-in-trades-breaking-barriers-and-building-futures/#:%7E:text=Statistics%20and%20Trends,gap%20in%20other%20sectors%205.\">growing numbers of women in apprenticeships and skilled-trades work</a>. While the problems that tradeswomen encounter in 2025 haven’t changed in nature since 1985, it seems these problems are more readily acknowledged and less ubiquitous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the body of research on tradeswomen is growing, which can lead to new solutions to old problems. In 2021, for example, Bridges and her co-researchers looked to <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12672\">scholarship on resilience</a> to understand how male-dominated industries might better support tradeswomen. They found that mentoring, role models and networking opportunities, as well as formal health and safety rules and policies such as flexible schedules, help tradeswomen thrive.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, while most research on women in skilled trades has historically focused on tradeswomen in the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and other Western countries, new scholarship is providing insight into the experiences of tradeswomen elsewhere. </p>\n\n<p>For example, education researchers Joyceline Alla-Mensah and Simon McGrath published an article in March 2025 about barriers to Ghanaian women’s participation in skilled trades. Their interviews brought to light new findings – for example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14480220.2025.2483198\">the importance of land ownership to Ghanaian tradeswomen</a>. Researchers are just now beginning to understand the experiences of women in trades all around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Back in 1985, Schroedel wrote that she had three goals for “Alone in a Crowd”: to let women doing nontraditional work know that they’re not alone, to shed light on their work situations, and to tell the largely overlooked stories of working-class women. </p>\n\n<p>While the outlook for tradeswomen is brighter than it was back in 1985, it would nevertheless be possible to begin a 2025 sequel to “Alone in a Crowd” with the same three goals. And that says something about how far the U.S. has yet to go.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/262307/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>I work for Howe&#39;s Welding and Metal Fabrication.</span></em></p>",

The <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\">headline unemployment rate has stayed steady</a> at near record lows, but the underlying trends are more concerning.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, the fight against inflation is not over yet. While a cooling jobs market could lead to a recession, cutting rates too much could drive inflation higher. </p>\n\n<p>So if you’re the Fed, what do you do?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Liju3o8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">I’m an economist</a> who tracks labor market data and monetary policy, examining how changes in hiring, wages and unemployment influence the Federal Reserve’s efforts to steer the economy.

These workers now make up 25.7% of all unemployed people, the highest share since <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2025/long-term-unemployed-accounted-for-25-7-percent-of-all-unemployed-people-in-august-2025.htm\">February 2022</a>. Persistent long-term joblessness often signals deeper cracks forming in the labor market.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICNSA\">new claims for unemployment benefits</a> are spiking. Initial claims for unemployment insurance – a leading indicator of labor market stress – jumped by 27,000 to 263,000 for the week ending Sept. 6, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. That’s the sharpest increase in months and well above economists’ forecasts. It suggests layoffs are becoming more common.</p>\n\n<p>We also got news that past payroll growth was overstated. In a process the Bureau of Labor Statistics undertakes annually to double-check its data, the bureau <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/09/business/jobs-revisions-economy-fed.html\">recently revised its jobs data</a> downward from April 2024 through March 2025 by 911,000. In other words, the economy created roughly 75,000 fewer jobs per month than previously reported. This implies the labor market was weaker than it appeared all along.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, workers are losing confidence. The <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce#/jobfind-1\">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> reported in August that  the confidence of people who lost their jobs in finding another fell to its lowest level – 44.9% – since it started surveying consumers in June 2013. That’s another sign workers are feeling less secure about their prospects. </p>\n\n<p>Taken together, these data points paint a clear picture: The labor market is not collapsing, but it is softening. That helps explain why the Fed is beginning to cut rates now – hoping to stimulate spending – before the job market breaks more sharply.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"packages of bacon and other meat are on display in a grocery store\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=399&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691457/original/file-20250917-76-gg0tug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=502&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Prices of meat and other groceries have been on the rise recently.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/processed-meat-is-offered-for-sale-at-a-grocery-store-on-news-photo/2194097444\">Scott Olson/Getty Images</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>Tariffs are complicating the inflation data</h2>\n\n<p>Even as the labor market softens, <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-consumer-price-hikes-inflation-coffee-autos-apparel-cpi/\">tariffs are pushing certain prices higher</a> than they otherwise would be, complicating the Federal Reserve’s effort to bring inflation down. </p>\n\n<p>Government data shows that businesses have begun passing the costs of President Donald Trump’s new import tariffs to consumers. In August, <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm\">clothing prices rose 0.5%</a> and grocery prices rose 0.6%, with especially strong gains for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/12/food/coffee-prices\">tariff-sensitive items such as coffee</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Lower-income households <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2ze83x7j0o\">are getting hit hardest</a> because they spend more of their budget on imported goods, which tend to be the lower-cost items most affected by tariffs. A report from the Yale Budget Lab found that <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/short-run-effects-2025-tariffs-so-far\">core goods prices</a> are about 1.9% above pre-2025 trends as tariffs raise costs for basic items such as appliances and electronics.</p>\n\n<p>Phillip Swagel, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said recently that Trump’s tariffs <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/15/trump-trade-inflation-tariffs-cbo.html\">have pushed inflation higher than CBO analysts had expected</a>, even as overall economic activity has weakened since January. </p>\n\n<p>Typically, a slowdown in the labor market is met with slower inflation. But while the CBO now projects that the tariffs will reduce the federal budget deficit by about US$4 trillion over the next decade – roughly $3.3 trillion in new revenue and $700 billion in lower debt service costs – <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61697\">but it will come at the cost of near-term upward pressure on prices</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This creates a difficult balancing act for the Fed: Cut rates too quickly, and tariff-driven price pressures could reignite inflation; move too slowly, and the softening labor market could tip into recession.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"align-center \">\n            <img alt=\"a bespectacled white man in a vest look on as a tv screen shows news of fed rate cut behind him\" src=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip\" srcset=\"https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=30&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/691495/original/file-20250917-66-nxedle.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=15&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;h=503&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=3 2262w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px\">\n            <figcaption>\n              <span class=\"caption\">Traders react to the Fed news.</span>\n              <span class=\"attribution\"><a class=\"source\" href=\"https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/FinancialMarketsWallStreetFederalReserve/4edc6f608d604541806293ef6b76cd0f/photo?vs=false\">AP Photo/Richard Drew</a></span>\n            </figcaption>\n          </figure>\n\n<h2>A narrow path to a soft landing</h2>\n\n<p>As it resumes cutting rates, the Federal Reserve is trying to thread a narrow needle – easing policy enough to keep the labor market from cracking while not reigniting inflation, which is proving stickier in part because of tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>Markets are betting the Fed will keep cutting. The futures market is betting the Fed will cut rates by <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\">another half point by the end of the year</a>. And the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS1\">one-year Treasury yield</a> has dropped about 150 basis points (1.5%) since June, signaling that investors expect a series of rate cuts through 2025 and into 2026. </p>\n\n<p>At its latest meeting, the Fed <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20250917.htm\">signaled two more rate cuts</a> in 2025 and at least one rate cut in 2026.</p>\n\n<p>Such cuts would ultimately bring the federal funds rate closer to 3% and hopefully reduce 30-year mortgage rates to around 5% – from an <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US\">average of 6.35% as of Sept. 11</a>. If the labor market continues to weaken – with jobless claims climbing, payrolls revised down and more workers stuck in long-term unemployment – that expectation will likely harden into consensus.</p>\n\n<p>But the path is far from certain. Cutting rates too quickly could cause inflation to spike, while going too slow could lead to further deterioration in the labor market. Either outcome would jeopardize the Fed’s credibility – whether by appearing unable to control prices or by allowing unemployment to rise unnecessarily. That would undermine its ability to influence markets and enforce <a href=\"https://www.chicagofed.org/research/dual-mandate/dual-mandate\">its dual mandate</a> of maximum employment and stable prices.</p>\n\n<p>Another tricky issue is Trump’s public campaign to push the Fed to cut rates – appearing to do his bidding could also undercut Fed credibility. For what it’s worth, the Sept. 17 rate cut appears driven less by politics than by economic data. The Fed itself <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240918.htm\">was projecting a year ago</a> that rates would be much lower today than they actually are, suggesting it’s been following the data.</p>\n\n<p>The economy appears to be slowing but remains resilient, which is why the Fed is likely to move gradually. The risk is that the window for a soft landing is closing. The coming months will determine whether the Fed can ease early enough to avoid recession, or whether it has already waited too long.</p><img src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/265370/count.gif\" alt=\"The Conversation\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />\n<p class=\"fine-print\"><em><span>Ryan Herzog does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organization that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</span></em></p>",
